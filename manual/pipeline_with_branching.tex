\chapter{Pipelining with Branching}


\section{Overview}
Once your pipeline is working with the simple set of commands that I provided, it is time to add branching.  

We will put the following restrictions on our efforts to branch:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use Branch Not Taken method of prediction
	\item You do not need to move the branch decision to the Decode stage as mentioned in the lecture.  We will keep it simpler and leave branch decision in the Memory stage.  This will leave us with a 3 cycle delay when a branch is taken.
	\item When a branch is taken, you must insert nops by zeroing the control lines.
	\item Instructions used for this should be the division problem instructions.  You need to insert nops (all zeros) in the instruction file where necessary.  The only reason to add nops in the instruction file is a data hazard
\end{enumerate}  

\section{Your Assignment}

You are to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement Branch Not Taken Prediction
\item Create an instruction file as described above, based on the division problem instruction file
\item Update your modules to add code to zero out control registers based on the branch decision
\item Use the instruction to test the pipeline and correct any issues
\item Submit a lab report using the PipelineLabWriteup format.
\end{enumerate}
