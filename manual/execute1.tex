\chapter{ALU and ALU Control}
The goal of this lab is to build the ALU and ALU Control modules. These modules can be seen in the context of the datapath by viewing the datapath diagram from the previous lab, Figure~\ref{fig:decode_stage}.  The ALU performs the arithmetic and logical operations, and the ALU Control module determines which operation should be performed by the ALU.  During this lab, we will not put these modules together.  Instead, they will be tested independently of each other.
\section{ALU}
The ALU has three inputs:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a\_in - the first input operand
	\item b\_in - the second input operand
	\item alu\_control - control signal used to tell the ALU what operation to perform
\end{enumerate}
The ALU has two outputs:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item alu\_result - the result of the arithmetic/logic operation
	\item zero - a flag indicating whether alu\_result is zero
\end{enumerate}  
Figure~\ref{fig:alu_control_table} identifies the operation that corresponds to the alu\_ctrl value.  You should use a case statement to evaluate the alu\_control bits to determine which ALU operation to perform.  For each operation, you do not have to do anything fancy.  You just need to use the math capability that verilog provides to make the calculation.  To make the code readable, you must give the the ALU control bits names in the definitions.vh file, and you should use these in your cases.  Also don't forget to make a default case, which is needed to actually wire this up.  Pick something fast for the default, thus usually a logic statement.

One last thing to note is the generation of the zero flag.  The zero flag is determine by simply evaluating the alu\_result.  There are several ways to handle this, but the easiest way to handle it is below: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item In Verilog (like C), the statement $(y==0)$ is an operation with a boolean output.  You can thus say $x=(y==0);$ to assign $x$ to be the boolean value that $(y==0)$ produced.  The statement $x=(y==0);$ is realizable as a digital comparator with $y$ and $0$ as inputs and $x$ as the single bit output.
\end{enumerate}

\section{ALU Control}
The ALU Control module has two inputs:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item alu\_op - 2 bit signal giving incomplete information about what ALU operation should be performed
	\item opcode - the opcode of the instruction
\end{enumerate}
The ALU Control module has one output:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item alu\_control - control signal used to tell the ALU what operation to perform
\end{enumerate}
Please define the ALU Op constants and ALU Control constants in definitions.vh file to improve readability.  Figure~\ref{fig:alu_control_table} identifies the operation that corresponds to the alu\_ctrl value.  This module can be implemented multiple ways, but we want to use the most efficient way possible.  The most efficient method is to use a casex statement to evaluate the alu\_op signal, utilizing the information in Figure~\ref{fig:alu_op_opcode_table}.  alu\_op will provide all information necessary for D-Type and CB-Type instructions.  For R-Type instructions, you should use the bits of the opcode to set the alu\_ctrl value.  When evaluating Figure~\ref{fig:alu_op_opcode_table} for R-Type instructions, certain bits of the instruction correspond to alu\_ctrl bits.  The magic decoder ring is listed below.  Please note that the numbering system for the instruction bits includes the entire instruction, whereas you will just have the opcode to work with.  Therefore, you will need to adjust the numbering to account for your 11-bit opcode.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ALU Ctrl [3] = 0
	\item ALU Ctrl [2] = I[30]
	\item ALU Ctrl [1] = I[24]
	\item ALU Ctrl [0] = I[29]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Your Assignment}

You are to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create the ALU module.
\item Create an ALU testbench to test all ALU operations, including testing the zero bit.
\item Create an ALU Control module.
\item Create an ALU Control testbench to test all of the opcode/ALUOp pairs that will be used in our instruction subset.
\item You do not need to create Expected Results tables for these tests, as they are very short and simple.
\item Create a lab report in the LabN format.
\end{enumerate}
